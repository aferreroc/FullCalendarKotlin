## To Get Started (only development mode)
Make sure you have java and git installed (possibly may also need npm installed):

    git clone https://github.com/aferreroc/FullCalendarKotlin
    cd FullCalendarKotlin
    ./gradlew browserDevelopmentRun

If you want contiuous development mode:

    ./gradelew browserDevelopmentRun --contiuous
    
In Windows it is probably (but have not tried it) more like:

    git clone https://github.com/aferreroc/FullCalendarKotlin
    cd FullCalendarKotlin
    gradlew.bat browserDevelopmentRun
