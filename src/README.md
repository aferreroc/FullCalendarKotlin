# Test Fullcalendar Kotlin with drag and drop

(please star it!)

The app expects the components project to be at the same level as this project
and references it in the webpack.configs and in the build.gradle.kts files.
Note that this will occur if you checkout the git project anyway.

It is a test to see how to interact with the Kotlin wrapper for React library 
with the fullcalendar library

## To Get Started
Make sure you have java and git installed (possibly may also need npm installed):

    git clone https://aferreroc@bitbucket.org/aferreroc/backend.git
    cd operaciones
    ./gradlew :muirwik-testapp:yarn
    ./gradlew :muirwik-testapp:build
    ./gradlew :muirwik-testapp:runServerOpenBrowser

In Windows it is probably (but have not tried it) more like:

    git clone https://aferreroc@bitbucket.org/aferreroc/backend.git
    cd operaciones
    gradlew.bat :muirwik-testapp:yarn
    gradlew.bat :muirwik-testapp:build
    gradlew.bat :muirwik-testapp:runServerOpenBrowser
